# Summarizing a Table

- We're just taking a look at the relevant columns here. We don't need to narrow it like this to do our summary, though.


```{r 05-work-with-dplyr-and-geoms-7 }
gss_sm |> 
  select(id, bigregion, religion) 
```


---

`r chunk_reveal("reveal-onetablevar", widths = c(35,65), title = "# Count up by .kjh-orange[_one_] column or variable")`

```{r reveal-onetablevar, include = FALSE}
gss_sm |> 
  group_by(bigregion) |>  #<<
  summarize(total = n()) 
```

Grouping changes the _logical_ structure of the tibble. It tells you what subsets of rows the next mutate or summary operation will be carried out within. 

---
`r chunk_reveal("reveal-pipe1", widths = c(35,65), title = "# Summarize by region and religion")`

```{r reveal-pipe1, include = FALSE}
gss_sm |>  
  group_by(bigregion, religion) |> 
  summarize(total = n()) |> 
  mutate(freq = total / sum(total),
           pct = round((freq*100), 1))

```
---

# Pipelines carry assumptions forward

```{r 05-work-with-dplyr-and-geoms-9 }

  summarize(total = n()) |> 
  mutate(freq = total / sum(total),
           pct = round((freq*100), 1))
```
]

Groups are carried forward till summarized over, or explicitly ungrouped with .kjh-green[`ungroup()`]. 

--

Summary calculations are done on the innermost group, which then "disappears". (Notice how .kjh-orange[`religion`] is no longer a group in the output, but .kjh-orange[`bigregion`] is.)

---

# Pipelines carry assumptions forward

.small[
```{r 05-work-with-dplyr-and-geoms-10 }
gss_sm |>

  summarize(total = n()) |> 
  mutate(freq = total / sum(total),
         pct = round((freq*100), 1)) #<<
```
]

.kjh-green[**`mutate()`**] is quite clever. See how we can immediately use .kjh-orange[**`freq`**] to calculate .kjh-orange[**`pct`**], even though we are creating them both in the same .kjh-green[**`mutate()`**] expression.

---

# Convenience functions

  mutate(freq = total / sum(total),
           pct = round((freq*100), 1)) 
```
]

We're going to be doing this .kjh-green[**`group_by()`**] ... .kjh-green[**`n()`**] step a lot. Some shorthand for it would be useful.

.SMALL.squish3[.kjh-green[**`count()`**] returns ungrouped results, so there are no groups carry forward to the .kjh-green[**`mutate()`**] step.]

.SMALL.squish3[.kjh-green[**`group_by()`**] and .kjh-green[**`tally()`**] both return a grouped result. We get some rounding error because we used .kjh-green[**`round()`**] after summing originally.]

# Two lessons

## Check your tables!

-     Pipelines feed their content forward, so you need to make sure your results are not incorrect.

--

- Often, complex tables and graphs can be disturbingly plausible even when wrong.

--

- So, figure out what the result should be and test it!

--

- Starting with simple or toy cases can help with this process.

---

# Two lessons

## Inspect your pipes!

- Understand pipelines by running them forward or peeling them back a step at a time.

- This is a _very_ effective way to understand your own and other people's code.
